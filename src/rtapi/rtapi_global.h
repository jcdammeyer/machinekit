/** the global_data structure resides in a shared memory segment and is
    unversally accessible to all entities with the HAL/RTAPI universe,
    including (but not limited to):

    The realtime RTAPI - thread, module, shm support - regardless of
    threadstyle (both kernel threads and userland threads have uniform
    access)

    The realtime ULAPI - the support code used by RT components

    The userland HAL and RT support API's - arbitrary user processes
    like halcmd, or userland HAL drivers and components

    The global_data structure carries the following types of information:

    Session parameters - e.g. the desired threadstyle since the build now supports
    runtime choice of threadstyle - for instance a non-RT (formerly 'sim',
    nowadays 'posix threads') session, or a an RT session as supported
    by the currently running kernel

    Dynamic sizing values, e.g. the HAL shm segment size. These values 
    change from 'compiled in' to 'startup parameter'.

    Data which should be shared within a session, for instance, the
    RTAPI message level. This was not possible so far and fairly confusing.

    Support data:

    a global counter for the next module ID (next_module_id) which is 
    needed by userland threadstyles since they do not arrays for modules.
    (this was formerly Jeff Epler's 'uuid' mechanism).

    Other possible uses of global_data include, but are not limited to,
    for instance instance management if one were to support multiple 
    HAL/RTAPI instances within a single machine.
